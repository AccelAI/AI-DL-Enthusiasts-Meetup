# Leader Guidelines for the AIDLE Research Paper Discussion Group

## Purpose

The purpose of the paper discussion meetup is to informally discuss the technical details of a research paper that you are especially interested in (related to AI and deep learning).  The goal is not necessarily to go through the whole paper, but to gain a better understanding of the key takeaways, findings, and applications for future use. 

## Leading a Discussion

If you have a particular paper you are interested in and would like to discuss it with others, then simply propose the discussion on this meetup. Send an email to the organizers stating the paper and roughly when you’d like to host it and we will give you host status to allow you to post the announcement on our community meetup site.

## Payments

Although most of our sessions are free and open to the public, you may charge the attendees a few dollars donation to bring in the more committed members.  To charge you could use your own Paypal account and post the email address for accepting payments. We recommend obtaining a special email account like joe_smith.paperdis@gmail.com for related correspondence and for your Paypal  account if you are to obtain one.
Alternatively, you could ask that the donations be made to the AIDLE Open Collective account, which helps cover costs of maintaining our group on meetup.com.

## Steps

### Prior to the Discussion:

 1. Email Organizers: John Jameson (john.paperdis@gmail.com) and Laura Montoya (meetup@accel.ai) the following:

    a. One or more papers you’d like to discuss (only one will be chosen)
    
        * If multiple papers are proposed, you’ll need to add a poll to the event page so that attendees may vote on the preferred paper.
        
    b. What possible day/times you’d like to have the discussion
    
    c. If all is well, Laura will give you “host” status to you can announce the discussion etc.
    
    d. If this is your first time leading a session, Jameson or Montoya will join the session to help with moderation and any roadblocks you may encounter.
    
2. Announce the meeting on the “AI & Deep Learning Enthusiasts” (AIDLE) Meetup site:

    a. Prepare an opening presentation, 5 to 30 minutes long, that introduces the paper and what you are particularly curious about or most interested in.
    
    b. To announce the discussion, first go to: https://www.meetup.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Deep-Learning-Enthusiasts-Meetup/
    
    c. Hover the cursor over “group tools” and select “schedule a meetup”
    
    d. In “select date and time” don’t forget to include the time zone, e.g., 7 pm PDT
    
    e. In “select a place” choose “Online via Uberconference”
    
    f. In the box “what should we do?” put “AI Research Discussion Session (Online): Name of the Paper”
    
    g. In the box “Details” use the cover message shown on the last page in this guide to announce the paper (which goes over the attendee guidelines). It consists of two parts. The first part regards the specific paper and should include:
    
        * Title of the paper 
        
        * Download link for the paper and links to any other useful information
        
        * How much you’ll charge for each attendee  ($2 typical, but can be free). If you plan to charge for the discussion (recommended), you will need a paypal account if you don’t have one, or at least some way attendees can pay you directly by credit card (with instructions on how to do so).
        
        * Any other information useful for the specific paper discussion
        
    The second part covers the general notes for the attendees. You should simply copy and paste the section at the end of these notes as the second half of 

    h. Review it a few times and then post the message (you can always edit later as well)
    
    i. Obtain a free uberconference account (note the web address for your account). Note that you may need to upgrade this account for $20 for one month if you expect to have more than 10 people (another reason you may want to charge for attendance)
    
3. Advertise the event on our FB social media group to gain more attendees from around the world.

    a. https://www.facebook.com/groups/AI.DL.Enthusiasts/
    
4. Send Reminder Notes

    a. It’s easy for attendees to forget they signed up for an event, email reminders help ensure you’ll have good attendance and hopefully a fulfilling discussion session.
    
    b. To send out emails only to members on the “RSVPd” list, on the main page of the discussion, hover over “group tools” and select “email members”, then on the “email members” page select “see more options” and then click on the selection drop down list under “Members subscribed to Meetup messages for” and then select the appropriate class of members, e.g., “Members who RSVP’ed Yes for this Meetup,” and then fill out the email details and send.
    
    c. Three days before the discussion send out reminder emails to the “RSVPd” list about the upcoming discussion, and if they haven’t paid, to do so before 8pm on the day of the discussion. Do this two days before as well.
    
    d. On the morning of the day of the meetup: email the web address for the discussion, e.g., www.uberconference.com/johndoe, to only the members that are going to the meetup (“RSVP’d”); this is to be done on the morning of the day of the meetup. 

### Twenty Minutes Before the Discussion

1. Make a list on your computer in a text file of all the (RSVP’d) attendees for the deputy (the deputy will keep track of the attendees; see below).
2. Log into your online conference account.
3. If you want, turn the recording with the control at the bottom.

### The Discussion

1. Wait until about 10 minutes after the start time to actually start the meeting (or sooner if all the attendees are present).
2. Announce first that you are recording, but that it is not meant for public distribution, and they can download a copy themselves if they like.
3. Have each person briefly introduce themselves: say their name (pay attention, they are typically from all over the world!), where they are, and their affiliation. Then introduce yourself in the same way.
4. Explain how to use the screenshare function, so that any attendee may share their screen during the session.
5. Appoint an attendee to be the deputy and text the names of the attendees so that the deputy can use these to remove attendees who did not reserve a spot or anyone being disruptive during the session. 
6. Give your opening  presentation. Ask for questions at regular intervals! Make sure they understand the concepts you are covering and are following along.
7. Go for as long as you like. 1-2 hours is probably typical.

### After The Discussion

1. You may email the attendees to get any thoughts they may have about the discussion, and whether you think  another discussion on the same paper might be worth it (and whether an attendee might want to lead it if you are not interested). 
2. Please send any comments to Jameson and/or Montoya about how this system might be improved.

Copy and paste the following at the end of your announcement:

General Notes for Attendees

The main function for these discussion sessions is to understand deep learning papers much faster. The idea is to understand the key concepts in the paper, not to go over all the minutia. Some papers may require more than one discussion period. 

We will use (Your Prefered Online Conference Service), at least initially, so you need to sign up for a free account. It does not use video, but instead, shows your photo with an animation that indicates when you are speaking. Video would be nice, but we feel that high-quality audio is more valuable than video at this point. So it is important that you add your photo.

Each discussion group will have a “leader” who moderates the discussion, and may also give a short lead off presentation. We are experimenting with the best medium for hosting these sessions. Feel free to offer suggestions as we go along.

Attendee Guidelines: 

1. Try to read the paper and find a few good questions and/or insights.
2. Be on time, latecomers can be disruptive for online discussions
3. Use a headset in a quiet location if possible, and have a good internet connection: good audio quality is essential
4. Have the discussion paper on your desktop ready to show via screen sharing in the event you need to point to something in a figure e.g.
5. There are no silly questions!

To reserve your spot: please deposit $2 to PayPal to youremail@email.com (or via AIDLE Open Collective). Those who have not paid by (8 pm PDT the day before the discussion) will be removed from the "going" list.  A link to the discussion will be emailed to each attending member on the day of the discussion.

Looking forward to the discussion! 

Best,  
Your Name
