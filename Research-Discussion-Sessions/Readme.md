# AI Research Discussions by AIDLE

The main function for these discussion sessions is to understand AI research papers through community engagement and cross-collaboration. The idea is to understand the key concepts in the paper, not to go over all the minutia. Some papers may require more than one discussion period.

We will use Zoom with audio, video, and live recording capabilities.

Each discussion group will have a “leader” who moderates the discussion, and may also give a short lead of the presentation.

When possible, we'll invite the author(s) of the paper to join us to answer questions, not to give an in-depth presentation, but rather help facilitate the discussion and understanding.

## Attendee Guidelines:

- Try to read the paper and find a few good questions and/or insights.

- Be on time, latecomers can be disruptive for online discussions

- Use a headset in a quiet location if possible, and have a good internet connection: good audio quality is essential

- Have the discussion paper on your desktop ready to show via screen sharing in the event you need to point to something in a figure e.g.

- There are no silly questions!

- AIDLE has strict guidelines regarding discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, class, and prior experience or educational background. We are all here to learn and grow! Violators will be removed from the group immediately.
